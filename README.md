# goal_babbling_cae_episodic_memory
Experiment on goal-directed exploration driven by artificial curiosity. The system uses a convolutional autoencoder to compress visual input, and explores in the spaces of the latent CAE representations. Inverse and forward models are implemented using shallow networks. An episodic memory system is adopted to face catastrophic forgetting issues. This code has been initiated during the EU-H2020 ROMI (Robotics for Microfarms, romi-project.eu) project and further developed during the EU-H2020 Marie Sklodowska Curie "Predictive Robots" project (http://www.guidoschillaci.eu/predictive-robots).
